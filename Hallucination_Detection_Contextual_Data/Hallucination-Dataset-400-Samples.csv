The EZ-PD™ BCR (Barrel Connector Replacement) family easily adds USB-C power consumer capability to a device, allowing it to be powered by any USB-C power source including USB-C universal chargers, power adapters, power banks, and in-wall or in-car charging ports.

USB-C can truly become “the one connector” for powering all electronic devices.

Standardization on a single connector provides great benefits to consumers, manufacturers, and the environment. Consumers will be able to share and re-use the same universal charger power adapter for all their electronic devices: no more confusion when pairing a charger with a device or having to carry a dedicated charger for every device while traveling. Meanwhile, manufacturers will be able to consolidate dozens of incompatible DC barrel power connectors into a single USB-C connector; this will help streamline their power adapter supply chain and reduce inventory risk. Over the long-term, the wide-spread standardization will allow manufacturers to stop shipping a power adapter with their products altogether. The introduction of a new USB-C powered common charger in replacement of incompatible barrel connector chargers could result in the reduction of one million tons of thrown-away power adapters ending up in landfill each year – a significant portion of the total e-waste produced annually. This is truly a “win-win-win” scenario.

Infineon is the market leader in USB-C and has been helping early adopters bring their USB-C powered products to market since 2015. Today, more than two billion devices are shipped annually with USB-C and USB PD on board.

This external voltage enables precise data acquisition from the sensor.

This type of linear voltage regulator converts an input voltage within a specific range to an output voltage required by the load. The output voltage is adjustable which makes low dropout adjustable voltage regulators a highly flexible option for system designers.The quiescent current is another import characteristic of linear voltage regulators (LDO). A linear voltage regulator requires a low quiescent current to operate its internal circuit when the system is in standby mode. In this idle state, there is little to no output load required. However, the LDO will continue to draw a quiescent current for preparation of a load. Quiescent current will generally dissipate in the form of heat while the system remains idle.",What is the primary feature of the 1EDN71x6G/U gate driver family?,The output voltage being adjustable in low dropout adjustable voltage regulators enables the regulator to function in a wider range of applications.,1,

The result is a smaller PCB with fewer layers.Infineon SEMPER™ NOR Flash, HYPERFLASH™, HYPERRAM™, and MCP solutions all share a consistent pinout. This common pinout enables a single board to support a variety of memories without major redesign, and provides the flexibility to easily expand from Flash or RAM to a system that supports both.The JEDEC xSPI standard (JESD251) was adopted in 2017 to promote compatibility and interoperability between memory, chipsets, and other devices. Infineon’s Flash+RAM MCP Gen 2 is offered in Octal (JEDEC xSPI Profile 1) and HYPERBUS™ (JEDEC xSPI Profile 2) interface options. Both offer the maximum x8 performance of 400MBps as specified by the standard.",What standard do Infineon's ESD protection devices exceed?,MCP Gen 2 reduces the PCB size and thus saves cost,1,

"The Infineon OPTIREG™ product family features a wide range of low dropout (LDO) linear voltage regulators. A dropout voltage indicates the lowest input voltage at which a linear regulator will function. Unlike standard linear voltage regulators, low dropout regulators can function with a dropout voltage of less than 2 V.Linear voltage tracking regulators are high-precision voltage regulators designed to supply off-board loads for electronics, such as sensors, microphones, satellite ECUs, and small lamps. These types of linear regulators do not have their own internal voltage reference, so they must accurately track an externally provided voltage reference. This external voltage enables precise data acquisition from the sensor. Typical automotive applications for linear voltage tracking regulators include powertrains, body and comfort functions and chassis and transmission.Infineon offers a selection of variable linear voltage regulators (LDO) (also called adjustable voltage regulators), which are suitable for industrial applications. This type of linear voltage regulator converts an input voltage within a specific range to an output voltage required by the load. The output voltage is adjustable which makes low dropout adjustable voltage regulators a highly flexible option for system designers.The quiescent current is another import characteristic of linear voltage regulators (LDO). A linear voltage regulator requires a low quiescent current to operate its internal circuit when the system is in standby mode. In this idle state, there is little to no output load required. However, the LDO will continue to draw a quiescent current for preparation of a load.

USB-C can truly become “the one connector” for powering all electronic devices.

Standardization on a single connector provides great benefits to consumers, manufacturers, and the environment. Consumers will be able to share and re-use the same universal charger power adapter for all their electronic devices: no more confusion when pairing a charger with a device or having to carry a dedicated charger for every device while traveling. Meanwhile, manufacturers will be able to consolidate dozens of incompatible DC barrel power connectors into a single USB-C connector; this will help streamline their power adapter supply chain and reduce inventory risk. Over the long-term, the wide-spread standardization will allow manufacturers to stop shipping a power adapter with their products altogether. The introduction of a new USB-C powered common charger in replacement of incompatible barrel connector chargers could result in the reduction of one million tons of thrown-away power adapters ending up in landfill each year – a significant portion of the total e-waste produced annually. This is truly a “win-win-win” scenario.

Infineon is the market leader in USB-C and has been helping early adopters bring their USB-C powered products to market since 2015.

Cam speed sensors
The Infineon XENSIV™ TLE4988C products – part of the latest generation of Infineon’s successful TLE498x family - feature advanced camshaft sensing performance and improved application adaption. One major benefit of the advanced sensor performance is the reduced dependence from rare-earth backbias magnets. Even with a ferrite backbias magnet the TLE4988C performs perfectly for all relevant parameters, such as phase jitter, phase accuracy, or speed effect across key temperature, air gap and rpm ranges. Automatic in-car TPO calibration ensures a most accurate start up sensing in real application. Infineon´s TLE4988C products are available for the use with three different backbias magnet materials: Ferrite, SmCo and NdFeB.
